object->prototype



- root prototype: Object.prototype
- almost every obj has a prototype
    - an obj inherits from its prototype
    - its prototype is the fallback source for its props

- SEE ALSO
    - eloquent, p.102ff.
    - definitive, ch.6.3.2

EXAMPLE
(1)
Object.getPrototypeOf(Math.max) == Function.prototype; // => true
Object.getPrototypeOf([]) == Array.prototype;          // => true

(2)
let unitCircle = { r: 1 };          // an obj to inherit from
let c = Object.create(unitCircle);  // c inherits prop r
c.x = 1; c.y = 1;                   // c defines two props of its own
c.r = 2;                            // c overrides its inherited prop
console.log(unitCircle.r);          // => 1 (prototype is unaffected)
