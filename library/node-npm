package manager

- node package manager
- keeps track of dependencies in package.json
- by default, node installation ships with npm
- project-dependencies are stored in /node_modules
    - dev dependency: for dev-tools (not to run the code)
- commands, e.g.
    - npm init: creates package.json
    - npm install: downloads and installs dependencies declared in package.json
    - npx <tool>: runs locally installed tools, e.g. npx eslint or npx jest
    - npm list -g --depth=0: displays globally installed packages
