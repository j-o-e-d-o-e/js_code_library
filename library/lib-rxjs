lib->RxJS



- extensions of the ReactiveX (Rx) project
    - aims to provide reactive (event-based) concepts to various languages
    - dependency in package.json: { "rxjs": "^7.8.1" } (as of Sep '23)
        - for ES modules, requires "type": "module"
- Observable: represents source of future vals
- Observer: listens to vals delivered by Observable
    - typically, a callback-method passed to subscribe()
- Operator: allows to manipulate vals from Observable (in `rxjs/operators`)
    - create
        - of() for single vals
        - from() for arrays
    - combine
        - concat() combines multiple Observables sequentially
        - merge() combines multiple Observables into a single Observable
    - error handling
        - catchError() catches error
    - filter
        - filter() emits vals based on given predicate (like Array.filter())
        - take() emits first n vals (opposite to skip())
        - takeUntil() emits vals based on another Observable
    - transform
        - map() passes vals to the supplied func (like Array.map())
        - concatMap() transforms one val at a time triggered by completion of previous val
        - mergeMap() flattens vals into a single observable
        - switchMap() replaces current observable with another one
        - scan() accumulates/reduces vals continuously
        - reduce() combines vals to produce a single val (like Array.reduce())
- Pipe: allows to link multiple operators together (pipe() in `rxjs`)
- Subscription: produces a result from an Observable
    - subscribe() accepts single callback or object-map: {next: ..., error: ..., completed: ...}
- Subject: multicasts vals to multiple Observers (instead of single Observer as for Observable)

EXAMPLE
import {of} from 'rxjs';
import {filter, map} from 'rxjs/operators';

let observable = of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
const squareOdd = observable.pipe(
    filter(i => i % 2 !== 0),
    map(i => i * i)
);
let subscription = squareOdd.subscribe(i => console.log(i)); // 1 9 25
subscription.unsubscribe();
