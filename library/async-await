async/await

async/promise

since ES2017

keywords to simplify the use of Promises
    - allow to structure Promise-based code as if it was synchronous

(1) await
    - 'await p' waits until Promise p settles
        - if fulfilled, returns value
        - if rejected, throws error
    - if declared within a func, func has to be async
(2) async functions
    - declaring a func async means that its return-val will be a Promise
(3) for await..of (since ES2018)
    - assigns fulfillment-val of Promise-array to loop-var
    - instead of Promise.all(), computes result step-by-step (see entry: promise)
    - only valid within async func (like await)

EXAMPLE
(1)
let res = await Promise.resolve("abc");
console.log(res); // abc
try {
    let res = await Promise.reject("def");
} catch (err){
    console.log(err); // def
}
(2)
async function getHighScore() {
    let response = await fetch("/api/user/profile");
    let profile = await response.json();
    return profile.highScore;
}
(3)
// see setup() in code_library.js: callback of readdir() is declared async
let promises = filenames.map(fn => readTitleAndSrc(fn));
let count = 1;
for await (const [fn, lines] of promises) {
    library.push({index: count, fn, title: lines[0], src: lines[1]})
    count++;
}
