array

eloquent, p.62/definitive, ch.7

- are untyped: different elements of the same array may be of different types
- are dynamic: no need to declare a fixed size when creating it
- can be sparse: elements need not have contiguous indexes starting at 0
    - there may be gaps
    - value of length property > number of elements
    - created with Array() constructor, e.g. new Array(5)

'arr[arr.length] = 1' adds a new element (e.g. 1) by assignment (like push())
    - if length property is set to n < arr.length, any element whose index > n are deleted (1)

delete operator removes element from array, but does not affect length property (2)
    - if delete is used, the array becomes sparse

EXAMPLE
(1)
let a = [1,2,3];
a.length = 1;
console.log(a); // => [ 1 ]
(2)
let a = [1,2,3];
delete a[1]
console.log(1 in a); // => false
console.log(a.length); // => 3
