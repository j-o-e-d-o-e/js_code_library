module

eloquent, ch.9/definitive, ch.10

(1) CommonJS modules (Node)
    - each file is an independent module with a private namespace
        - consts, vars, funcs, and classes defined in one file are private to that file unless exported
        - exported values are only visible to those modules which explicitly import them
    - EXPORT
        - Node defines a global 'exports'-obj that is always defined (1.1)
            - to export, simply assign values to the properties of this obj
        - to export only a single func or class, use 'module.exports' (1.2)
            - default value of module.exports is the same obj that 'exports' refers to
            - to export a single obj, use modules.exports = {} at the end of the module (rather than one by one)
    - IMPORT
        - require()-func loads module and returns its interface (1.1)
            - if package, arg is its name (without "/")
            - if own code, arg is its relative path (typically, starts with "./")
                - .js-suffix can be omitted
        - if obj with multiple props, one can just import the specific props by destructing (1.2)
    - bundling-tools (like webpack) allow to use this style of modules for code that is intended to run in web browsers

(2) ES modules (since ES6)
    - modularity as a core language feature
    - like node, each file is its own module
        - node 13 supports ES6 modules
    - EXPORT
        - put keyword 'export' in front of a func, class or variable (let, const, var) (2.1)
            - only possible for declarations that have a name
        - to export from a single place (typically at the end of the module): export {} (2.2)
        - to export only one value, it is common to use 'export default' (2.3)
            - can export any expression, including anonymous funcs
        - named export, e.g. export { render as renderLayout };
    - IMPORT
        - 'import'-keyword loads exported values
            - string of the module from which a value is imported is a path (typically, starts with "./")
                - apparently, .js-suffix can not be omitted
            - wildcard-import, e.g. import * as stats from "./module.js" (2.1)
            - named import, e.g. import { render as renderUI } from "./ui.js"
        - to load an ES module in node, set "type": "module" in package.json

EXAMPLE
(1.1)
// 1st file
const sum = (x, y) => x + y;
exports.mean = data => data.reduce(sum)/data.length;
// 2nd file
const stats = require('./scratch.js');
let res = stats.mean([1,2,3]); // => 2
(1.2)
// 1st file
const mean = data => data.reduce((x, y) => x + y) / data.length;
module.exports = {mean}
// 2nd file
const {mean} = require('./scratch.js');
let res = mean([1, 2, 3]); // => 2
(2.1)
// 1st file
export const mean = data => data.reduce((x, y) => x + y) / data.length;
// 2nd file
import * as stats from './scratch.js'
let res = stats.mean([1, 2, 3]); // => 2
(2.2)
// 1st file
const mean = data => data.reduce((x, y) => x + y) / data.length;
export {mean};
// 2nd file
import {mean} from './scratch.js'
let res = mean([1, 2, 3]); // => 2
(2.3)
// 1st file
export default class Export {
    test() { console.log("Export imported."); }
}
// 2nd file
import Export from './scratch.js'
new Export().test(); // => Export imported.
