array

eloquent, p.62/definitive, ch.7

- are untyped: elems may be of different types
- can be sparse: elems need not have contiguous indices starting at 0
    - delete operator removes elem from array, but does not affect length (1)
    - i.e. length > number of elems
- 'arr[arr.length] = 1' adds new element by assignment
    - if length is set to n, any elem whose index > n is deleted (2)

EXAMPLE
(1)
let a = [1,2,3];
delete a[1]
console.log(1 in a); // => false
console.log(a.length); // => 3

(2)
let a = [1,2,3];
a.length = 1;
console.log(a); // => [ 1 ]
