array

eloquent, p.62/definitive, ch.7

- are untyped: elems may be of different types
- can be sparse: elems need not have contiguous indices starting at 0
    - delete operator removes elem from array, but does not affect length (1)
    - i.e. length > number of elems
    - alternatively, use splice(index, 1) (see entry array->methods)
- 'arr[arr.length] = 1' adds new element at the end
    - if index > length, arr becomes sparse with gaps/empty items (2)
- if length is set to n, any elems whose index > n is deleted (3)

EXAMPLE
(1)
let a = [1,2,3];
delete a[1]
console.log(1 in a); // => false
console.log(a.length); // => 3

(2)
let arr = Array(5,2);
arr[5] = 4; // [ 5, 2, <3 empty items>, 4 ], len=6

(3)
let a = [1,2,3];
a.length = 1;
console.log(a); // => [ 1 ]
