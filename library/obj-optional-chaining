object->optional chaining

operator

(1) ?.-operator allows to access props of an obj's prop without potientially throwing a TypeError
    - if prop does not have child, 'undefined' is returned; otherwise, val is returned
(2) ??-operator allows to set default val if prop is null or undefined (nullish coalescing operator)
- both since ES 2020

EXAMPLE
let devices = {desktop: {cpu: "ryzen"}};
let a = devices.laptop?.cpu;                // a = undefined
let b = devices.desktop.name ?? "no name";  // b = no name
