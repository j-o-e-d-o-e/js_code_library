object->optional chaining

operator

(1) ?.-operator allows to access props of an obj's prop without potientially throwing a TypeError
    - if prop does not have child, 'undefined' is returned; otherwise, val is returned
(2) ??-operator allows to set default val if prop is null or undefined (nullish coalescing operator)
- both since ES 2020

EXAMPLE
let desktop = {};
let a = desktop?.cpu;               // a = undefined
let b = desktop?.cpu ?? "ryzen";    // b = ryzen
