prototype

obj/prototype

- almost every object has a prototype (1)
- obj inherits from prototype
- prototype is fallback source of properties
- root prototype: Object.prototype
- querying props looks up prototypes; setting them overrides inherited prototypes (2)

- SEE ALSO
    - eloquent, p.102ff.
    - definitive, ch.6.3.2

EXAMPLE
(1)
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Math.max) == Function.prototype); // -> true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf([]) == Array.prototype);          // -> true
(2)
let unitCircle = { r: 1 };          // An object to inherit from
let c = Object.create(unitCircle);  // c inherits the property r
c.x = 1; c.y = 1;                   // c defines two properties of its own
c.r = 2;                            // c overrides its inherited property
console.log(unitCircle.r);          // => 1: the prototype is not affected
